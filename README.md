# Rainfall Modeling and Forecasting at Kualanamu Meteorological Station Using ARIMA and ANFIS Methods

My undergraduate thesis

# Description
Kualanamu Meteorological Station is one of the stations that serves as a weather
observer, one of which is rainfall. Rainfall is the amount of water that falls on flat
ground during a certain period measured in millimeters (mm) above the horizontal
surface. Rainfall information can be used as a reference in the planning process
for all aspects of society, so it is necessary to model and forecast the amount of
rainfall. The methods used in modeling and forecasting the amount of rainfall at
the Kualanamu Meteorological Station are ARIMA and ANFIS. ARIMA model is
a model that completely ignores the independent variables in making forecasts.
ANFIS is a hybrid algorithm which combines the Fuzzy Inference System
mechanism described in the neural network architecture. The best ARIMA model
obtained is ARIMA (1,0,0)(1,0,0)12 which produces RMSE 1.1623 and sMAPE
22,4966%. Meanwhile, with the ANFIS approach, the best ANFIS model obtained
is with the input on the grid partition technique, gauss membership
function, and membership number of 3 that produce RMSE 0.3221 and sMAPE
3,5196%. This shows that the ANFIS method shows better performance than
ARIMA because it produces smaller RMSE.
